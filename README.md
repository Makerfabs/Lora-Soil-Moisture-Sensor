# Introduce

The Lora soil moisture sensor is based on Atmel's Atmega328P, it collect local air temperature/ humidity with sensor AHT10, and detect the soil humidity with capacitor-humility measurement solution with 555, and transmit the local environment data to the gateway, with Lora communication, suit for applications for smart-farm, irrigation, agriculture, etc.
